Configuring mobile apps to work with wallabag
=============================================

Steps to configure the app
--------------------------

- First *create a new client* in the ``API clients management`` section. The name of your app doesn't matter as much as the ``Client ID`` and the ``Client secret``. Write these two values down.
- When you download a mobile app, it's going to ask for the server address of the hosted wallabag instance. For example, with wallabag.it that is: ``https://app.wallabag.it``.
- It's also going to ask for the aforementioned ``Client ID`` and ``secret``. Please insert those in the text fields, when asked.
- Lastly you need to provide your ``username`` and ``password``. These are the same credentials you use to login in to wallabag.

Please also have a look at `Android <android.html>`_ page. Especially the section on *known limitations*.
