Language
--------

wallabag (via graby) can detect article language. It's easy to you to retrieve articles
written in a specific language.

Reading time
------------

wallabag estimates how many time you need to read an article. With this filter,
you can for example find the articles with a reading time between 2 and 5 minutes.

Domain name
-----------

Thanks to this filter, you can retrieve the articles from the same domain name.
For example, in this field, type ``bbc.co.uk`` to retrieve the articles of this website.

-------------

When you save an article, wallabag stored the current date. So handful to retrieve articles written
between 1st and 31th January for example.
