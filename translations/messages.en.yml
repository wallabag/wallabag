            tagging_rules_definition_title: What does “tagging rules” mean?
            tagging_rules_definition_description: They are rules used by wallabag to automatically tag new entries.<br />Each time a new entry is added, all the tagging rules will be used to add the tags you configured, thus saving you the trouble of manually classifying your entries.
            how_to_use_them_title: How do I use them?
            how_to_use_them_description: 'Let us assume you want to tag new entries as « <i>short reading</i> » when the reading time is under 3 minutes.<br />In that case, you should put « readingTime &lt;= 3 » in the <i>Rule</i> field and « <i>short reading</i> » in the <i>Tags</i> field.<br />Several tags can added simultaneously by separating them with a comma: « <i>short reading, must read</i> »<br />Complex rules can be written by using predefined operators: if « <i>readingTime &gt;= 5 AND domainName = "www.php.net"</i> » then tag as « <i>long reading, php</i> »'
