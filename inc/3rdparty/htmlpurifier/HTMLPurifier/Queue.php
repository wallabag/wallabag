/**
 * A simple array-backed queue, based off of the classic Okasaki
 * persistent amortized queue.  The basic idea is to maintain two
 * stacks: an input stack and an output stack.  When the output
 * stack runs out, reverse the input stack and use it as the output
 * stack.
 *
 * We don't use the SPL implementation because it's only supported
 * on PHP 5.3 and later.
 *
 * Exercise: Prove that push/pop on this queue take amortized O(1) time.
 *
 * Exercise: Extend this queue to be a deque, while preserving amortized
 * O(1) time.  Some care must be taken on rebalancing to avoid quadratic
 * behaviour caused by repeatedly shuffling data from the input stack
 * to the output stack and back.
